This allows users to group by and aggregate\nrelation fields when configuring charts.\n\nChanges:\n- Allow relation fields in Group By field selection (X/Y axis)\n- Allow relation fields in Aggregate operation field selection\n- Remove isFieldRelation filter from available fields\n- Keep isSystem filter to prevent system fields from being shown\n\nThe backend already supports grouping by relation ID via the\nbuildGroupByFieldObject utility, which converts field.name to field.nameId\nfor relations.\n\nNote: Charts will display relation IDs (UUIDs) rather than human-readable\nlabels. Future enhancement needed to resolve label identifiers for better UX.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
